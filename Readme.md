This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. We can train the model on a custom dataset by organizing their images in the  and configuring parameters in the train.py file. The training script (train.py) saves the trained model in the files directory. To assess the model's performance, users can employ the test.py script, which loads the trained model and evaluates it on a specified test dataset. Customization options, including architecture and hyperparameters, can be performed. To get started, install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
